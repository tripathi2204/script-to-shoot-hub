    question: "How can you help filmmakers?",
    answer: "I offer a complete suite of pre-production services designed to give your project a competitive edge—budgets, schedule, and more. By integrating advanced workflows, I make these services significantly faster, more accurate, and cost-effective without sacrificing quality. Whether you're seeking funding, pitching to studios, or preparing for production, I ensure your materials are industry-ready and compelling enough to grab attention."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there exceptions to the turnaround time?",
    answer: "While the majority of projects are completed within 3–5 business days, turnaround times can vary based on the complexity, scope, and number of deliverables required. Projects with more intricate research, multiple creative elements, or large asset requirements may take longer."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my intellectual property safe with you?",
    answer: "All workflows are secured with password protection and handled with strict confidentiality. But still I recommend that all creators register their work with the Writers Guild of America West (WGAW) Registry, which is the industry standard for creating legal evidence of authorship. This extra step safeguards your creative rights, whether or not you choose to proceed with my services."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like the final work?",
    answer: "Your satisfaction is central to my process. After delivering the first draft, you'll have up to three days to review it and request changes. Depending on the package selected, you can receive up to two free revisions, during which I will make all necessary corrections, refinements, and creative adjustments to align with your vision."
  },
  {
    question: "In what format will I receive my deliveries?",
    answer: "All final materials are delivered in industry-standard formats, complete with source files, making them fully compatible with any production workflow. This ensures your project can seamlessly transition from pre-production into the filming stage without reformatting delays. If you have specific format or software requirements, you can discuss them before placing your order."
  },
  {
    question: "Who can use your services?",
    answer: "My services are ideal for anyone in the film and television industry who needs polished, professional pre-production materials. This includes screenwriters pitching to networks or development executives, studios seeking to attach agents or talent, and independent filmmakers aiming to reduce costs with remote production support. Whether you're in early concept development or on the verge of production, I can help you present your project in the strongest possible way."
